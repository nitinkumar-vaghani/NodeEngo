Youâ€™re looking at the **MongoDB connection options** that get appended to the connection string. Letâ€™s break each down and see what you actually need for a **local development setup** vs. production/cluster.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Options explained

### 1. **`authSource`**

* Tells MongoDB where to authenticate the user.
* Default: the same database you connect to.
* If you created your user in `admin`, you need:

  ```ts
  authSource: "admin"
  ```
* If you created your user in `credit_control`, you can leave it as that DB name.

âœ… For local dev: set this to the database where the user lives.

---

### 2. **`replicaSet`**

* Used when connecting to a replica set (MongoDB cluster with primary + secondaries).
* Tells the driver which replica set to join.
* Looks like:

  ```ts
  replicaSet: "rs0"
  ```
* If youâ€™re running a **single local `mongod` instance**, you **donâ€™t need this**.

âœ… For local dev: leave `undefined`.

---

### 3. **`tls`** (or `ssl`)

* Enables TLS/SSL encrypted connection to MongoDB.
* Needed in production (e.g. MongoDB Atlas, secured servers).
* For local dev, unless youâ€™ve enabled TLS certificates in `mongod.cfg`, you donâ€™t need it.

âœ… For local dev: leave `undefined` or `false`.

---

### 4. **`directConnection`**

* Forces the driver to connect **directly to a single host** instead of discovering via cluster metadata.
* Useful if connecting to a single local `mongod`.
* On MongoDB 5+, Atlas sometimes requires it for SRV connections.

âœ… For local dev: set `true` (makes the driver skip replica set discovery).

---

### 5. **`retryWrites`**

* When enabled, the driver will automatically retry certain write operations (like `insertOne`, `updateOne`) if a transient network error occurs.
* Default: `true` in most drivers.
* Safe to keep enabled for dev and production.

âœ… For local dev: set `true`.

## ðŸ›  Example for your **local MongoDB**

If you created a user inside `credit_control` DB:

```ts
const query = toQuery({
  authSource: "credit_control",   // where the user was created
  replicaSet: undefined,          // single server, no replica set
  tls: undefined,                 // no TLS for local
  directConnection: true,         // connect directly
  retryWrites: true,              // enable retries
});
```

Resulting connection string (simplified):

```
mongodb://ccDevApp:password@127.0.0.1:27017/credit_control?authSource=credit_control&directConnection=true&retryWrites=true
```

---

âœ… **Summary for Local Dev**

* `authSource`: match DB where you created the user (`admin` or `credit_control`).
* `replicaSet`: ignore.
* `tls`: ignore.
* `directConnection`: `true`.
* `retryWrites`: `true`.
