Here’s a breakdown of the three roles (readWrite, dbAdmin, dbOwner):

## 🔑 MongoDB Database Roles

### 1. **`readWrite`**

* **What it allows:**

  * Insert, update, delete, and query documents.
  * Create collections and indexes.
* **What it does NOT allow:**

  * Cannot manage users.
  * Cannot drop the database.
  * Cannot run admin commands.

✅ Best for **application users** that just need to read/write data.

---

### 2. **`dbAdmin`**

* **What it allows:**

  * View and modify database metadata.
  * Run admin commands like:

    * `collStats`, `dbStats`, `validate`, `createIndex`, `dropIndexes`
  * Manage profiling and diagnostics.
* **What it does NOT allow:**

  * Cannot insert/update/delete documents.
  * Cannot create/drop collections with data.
  * Cannot manage users.

✅ Best for **DBAs/monitoring tools** that only need schema/index management.

---

### 3. **`dbOwner`**

* **What it allows:**

  * Full control of the database.
  * Includes **both** `readWrite` and `dbAdmin`.
  * Can also **manage roles and users** within that DB.
* **What it does NOT allow:**

  * No direct access to other databases.
  * No cluster-wide admin access (unless explicitly given).

✅ Best for **application owner or team lead** who should manage everything inside one DB.

| readWrite | ✅               | ✅ (create/drop indexes) | ❌         | ❌            | ❌             |

👉 For your case (`cc_test` app database):

* If it’s **just for the app** → use `readWrite`.
* If app also needs to manage collections/indexes automatically → `dbOwner` is safer.
* For **production**: create **two users**:

  * `cc_test_app` → role `readWrite`
  * `cc_test_admin` → role `dbOwner`

That way your app won’t have unnecessary privileges.
